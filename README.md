### Hi there...
<img align="left" src="https://orhun.dev/img/crow.png"> 
<h4>I'm Andres Rechimon, professional mobile and web programmer since 2021<h4/> On my resume you'll find what technologies I'm familiar with and a GitHub link where you can check out what projects I've been working on (just for practice, real projects are not included for confidentiality), where mobile development is my main focus right know, although i have experience on web too. If I had to name a quality, I would say that it is the enthusiasm for study. I love to read and take courses in various areas of knowledge, so I have no problem getting training if the job requires it.
<br/>
<h4>What is my passion?<h4/>
Fundamentally I am interested in the study of science, its technique and application in the technologies that facilitate our lives. The contribution of these areas to our well-being is undeniable, as is their impact on human interactions, something that I am also very interested in understanding.
I worked in other places apart from those that I mention in my CV, but I did not specify them because of the orientation of the CV. I have experience in administration and tax collection for real estate (1 year), as a commercial employee (3 years in total) and sporadic shifts in transportation of generator sets.
